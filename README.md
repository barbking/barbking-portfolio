## My Portfolio Page

### Back End
- You have already been given a simple server. You don't need to change the code.
- As practice, comment each line of code in the server. Make sure you know what each line does.
- If you will be deploying this on Heroku, you will need to change the port so it isn't hard coded.

### Deploy
- Deploy the app on Heroku. It doesn't have a database so you can follow the same steps as we did in lecture.
- Here is the repo from the deployment lecture: [https://github.com/devjanaprime/herokuDeploy_noDb
](https://github.com/devjanaprime/herokuDeploy_noDb)

## Submit
- The github url (where the code lives)
- If deployed: The Heroku url (url of the deployed site)
