    After previously working as a process engineer in the semiconductor and hard drive industries,
    I decided to follow my passion into computer software development.  I received my certificate in
    Full Stack Software Development from Prime Digital Academy in July 2017.  When I'm not in front of my computer
    I can be found out running on the trails or at my children's sports activities.
